        This is probably the froodiest document that you will read all year. It has
        been authored using new means of achieving consensus that have been made
        possible through nanoethanol implants.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This is a wonderfully beautiful example document. If you're interested
        in such topics, you may wish to read section <a href='#dahut'></a> or
        look at pretty figure <a href='#fig-unicorns-make-you-sexy'></a>.

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, there was a working group that needed to write a
        specification using nothing but [[HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        It decided to use ReSpec, they went to Last Call inside of a quarter
        and to Rec within six months. They spent most of the rest of their
        chartered time having fun in exotic place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The End.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        The single conformance class described in this specification is the
        <dfn>cryptoanimal</dfn>, a class of common animals that some crazy
        people don't believe in.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Animals</h2>
      <p>
        There are two primary sorts of <a title='cryptoanimal'>cryptoanimals</a>
        that this specification is concerned with. They are detailed in the
        following sections.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Unicorn</h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>unicorn</dfn> is essentially a horned pegasus with no wings.
          Unicorns make great pets and can double as babysitters in a pinch.
        </p>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Dahut</h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>dahut</dfn> is an Alpine animal with legs shorter on one side than
          on the other in order to better walk around the mountain. There are two
          types, that vary on chirality. It is not to be confused with the chamois,
          a mythical mountain animal with two legs of the same size — a logical
          impossibility that will be clear to anyone who has been mountain climbing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further discussion of the <a>dahut</a> can be found in [[!SVGMOBILE12]].
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a simple example with just some text:
        </p>
        <pre class='example'>
          The milk of the right-handed dahut is considered by villagers to be bad
          for babies.
        </pre>
        <p>
          And here is one with syntax highlighting:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          function norm (str) {
              str = str.replace(/^\s+/, "").replace(/\s+$/, "");
              return str.split(/\s+/).join(" ");
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          You can also inline syntax highlighting as in
          <code class='highlight'>return str.replace(/^\s+/, "");</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can include arbitrary content that will be processed recursively:
        </p>
        <div data-include='snippet.html'></div>
        <p>
          You can also include as text:
        </p>
        <pre data-include='snippet.html' data-include-format='text'></pre>
        <p>
          You can also use transformations, although that feature is meant to
          be used with parsimony.
        </p>
        <script>
          function scream (obj, content) {
              return content.toUpperCase();
          }
          function blink (obj, content) {
              return "<span style='color: red; text-decoration: blink'>" +
                     content +
                     "</span>";
          }
        </script>
        <p data-transform='scream blink'>
          This used to be normal text, but now it's not.
